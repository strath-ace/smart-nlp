The spacecraft power system shall be made of solar arrays and batteries and shall cope with the power needs of the various spacecraft sub-systems as required, including P/L, at any stage of the mission as a function of the spacecraft power modes, including safe mode. | power
The spacecraft battery shall be sized for worst case eclipses and the descent/touchdown/re-ascent phase. | power
The sizing of the solar arrays shall allow the S/C to stay on a ”Radio-science” orbit and safe position as defined in 13.2. | power
The electrical design shall comply with the requirements of [RD6]. Tailoring of these requirements may be proposed and need to be justified. | power
The ECSS-E-20 (Electrical and Electronic) standard is applicable. | power
The electric power supply subsystem (EPS) shall provide the electric power required to satisfy all load requirements during all mission phases and for all operation modes. | power
Electrical power shall be guaranteed by a solar generator, its electrical configuration shall be defined on the basis of the topology selected for the EPS. | power
Degradation factors shall be taken into account to cater for efficiency changes of the energy conversion process due to the space environment, variations in solar illumination including the ensuing thermal effects and design uncertainties. | power
Cell performance and degradation factors shall be justified according to in orbit experience and supporting ground testing. | power
The worst case power margin at ENOL shall be positive. | power
Compliance of the energy storage capacity at ENOL at the prevailing temperature and for the expected number of cycles and depth-ofdischarge shall be ensured. | power
