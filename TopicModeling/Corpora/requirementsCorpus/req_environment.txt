The spacecraft composite and all its sub-systems, including payload, shall be compatible with the launch environment as defined in ([AD8]). | environment
The mission design shall be compliant with the general space environment (cruise) requirements defined in [RD4] and the mission-specific (e.g. asteroid) environment requirements defined in [AD4]. | environment
The sample shall never be exposed to magnetic field larger than 200 µT. | environment
The spacecraft shall satisfy the electric and magnetic cleanliness (EMC) requirements specified by the payload (TBD reference). | environment
The maximum surface temperature of the sampling site to be considered for the design of the spacecraft shall be 500 K (TBC). | environment
The mission design shall be compatible with the rotation period of the primary asteroid of ~ 3.6 hours +/- 0.1%. | environment
The surface properties which shall be assumed for the design of the sampling mechanism are as follows: ? No solid rock. Only loose material shall be assumed, ? Grain Size: µm ? up to 3 cm, ?
