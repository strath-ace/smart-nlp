The link budgets of the spacecraft to ground shall be calculated for a weather availability of 95%. | communication
Science data shall be downlinked by the spacecraft in X-band. | communication
The maximum bit error rate during data downlink shall be better than 10-5. | communication
The telecommunication system shall be capable of simultaneously handling telemetry, ranging and telecommands. | communication
The telecommunication equipment shall support the RSE as specified in [RD16]. | communication
The telecommunications system shall be able to downlink all science data as per R- SYS-410/420/430. | communication
All images taken by navigation cameras and required to be sent to ground (e.g. asteroid shape model, local slopes around sampling sites, etc.), if any, shall be downloaded. | communication
